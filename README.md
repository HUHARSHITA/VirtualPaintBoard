# VirtualPaintBoard
Experience the fusion of art and technology with my Virtual Paintboard project. Built using Python and OpenCV, this innovative application transforms any screen into a digital canvas. It currently offers 3 colours to paint and an eraser to undo the mistakes . It detects finger motions through webcam and display it on screen.
